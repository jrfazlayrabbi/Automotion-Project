**Car Parking System Using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)**

This project involves creating an automated **car parking system** using a **PLC**, designed to manage the parking and retrieval of cars in a multi-level parking facility. The PLC controls the entire process, ensuring efficient use of space, accurate vehicle placement, and retrieval.

### **Key Features**:
- **Automated Parking**: The PLC directs the car to an available parking spot using sensors and motors.
- **Efficient Space Management**: Optimizes the parking space by tracking available spots and guiding cars to them.
- **Automated Retrieval**: When a user requests their car, the PLC activates the system to retrieve it efficiently.
- **User Interface**: The system includes a simple interface for the driver to request parking or retrieval.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Ensures cars are parked and retrieved safely without human intervention.

### **Components Used**:
1. **PLC**: Main controller that processes input signals and controls output devices like motors and relays.
2. **Sensors**: Used to detect the presence of cars and monitor parking spots (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, proximity sensors).
3. **Conveyor Motors**: Used to move cars along designated paths within the parking facility.
4. **Relays/Contactors**: Control the movement of the parking platform or elevator systems.
5. **Push Buttons/Keypad**: Allows users to input commands for parking or retrieving their car.
6. **Display Panel**: Shows available parking spots, parking status, or instructions for the user.
7. **Car Lifting Mechanism**: For vertical movement in multi-level parking systems.

### **Working Principle**:
1. **Car Parking**:
   - The user enters the car into the parking area and presses a button for automatic parking.
   - The PLC checks for available parking spots using sensors.
   - It guides the car to an available spot, utilizing motors for horizontal and vertical movement.

2. **Car Retrieval**:
   - When the user wants to retrieve their car, they input the request (either via a button or keypad).
   - The PLC activates the system to move the car to a designated exit point, ensuring minimal waiting time.

3. **Space Management**:
   - The system continuously monitors all parking spots and updates the available spaces in real-time.
   - When a car enters or leaves, the PLC recalculates and updates the available spots accordingly.

### **Applications**:
- **Smart Parking Systems**: Automated parking for urban areas, reducing traffic congestion and optimizing space.
- **Multi-Level Parking**: Ideal for buildings with limited space but the need to accommodate many vehicles.
- **Commercial Use**: Shopping malls, airports, and office buildings where automated parking is necessary for efficient space utilization.

### **Benefits**:
- **Space Efficiency**: Maximizes parking space usage by automating the process and utilizing every available spot.
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent searching for a parking spot and retrieving cars.
- **Safety**: Minimizes the risk of accidents or damage through automated movement and control.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the need for manpower in managing parking facilities.

This project demonstrates how **PLC-based automation** can enhance **car parking systems**, making them **smarter, safer**, and more **efficient**. It offers a practical solution for urban areas where parking space is limited, contributing to more **sustainable** and **convenient** city living.
